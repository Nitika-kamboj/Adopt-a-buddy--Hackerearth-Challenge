Machine learning based approach to predict the type and breed of the animal based on its physical attributes and other factors.

# Problem Statement

Having a pet is one of life’s most fulfilling experiences. Your pets spoil you with their love, compassion and loyalty. And dare anyone lay a finger on you in your pet’s presence, they are in for a lot of trouble. Thanks to social media, videos of clumsy and fussy (yet adorable) pets from across the globe entertain you all day long. Their love is pure and infinite. So, in return, all pets deserve a warm and loving family, indeed. And occasional boops, of course.

Numerous organizations across the world provide shelter to all homeless animals until they are adopted into a new home. However, finding a loving family for them can be a daunting task at times.

The brighter side of the pandemic is an increase in animal adoption and fostering. To ensure that their customers stay indoors, a leading pet adoption agency plans on creating a virtual-tour experience, showcasing all animals available in their shelter. To enable that, we are building a Machine Learning model that determines type and breed of the animal based on its physical attributes and other factors.
